This is the source code of my responsive portfolio website https://hsairanen/github.io

My projects are introduced on the home page (index.html). You can open the menu by clicking the compass on the top right corner and navigate to different sections, to the about page (dist/about.html) or to the contact page (dist/contact.html).

The page is styled using Sass (scss/main.scss):
- The animations are placed in the file _animations.scss and they are switch on with Javascript (/js/main.js).
- The _config.scss file contains color parameters, font size parameters and media query mixins.
- The styles of the menu button and the overlay menu can be found in the file _menu.scss.
- The styles regarding screen orientation and different browser window sizes are placed in the file _mobile.scss.
